## **Stages of the internship**
Each stage of the internship is packed with learning and practical different mini-projects and final projects. All learning and mini-project teach you, improve your skills, and build your confidence to efficiently solve the final project.
 
⚠️The tasks for each stage depend on the learning track you will be working on. Also, this is not a fixed setup; expect a few variations here and there. However, here is what each stage is all about.

## **Stage 0: Technical Writing**
In this introductory stage, participants develop essential technical writing skills, focusing on clear and concise communication of complex scientific concepts. Interns will learn how to document research findings, write reports, and create educational content that is accessible to both scientific and general audiences.

## **Stage 1: Literature Review**
Participants will engage in a comprehensive literature review, critically analyzing existing research relevant to bioinformatics. This stage emphasizes the importance of understanding the current state of knowledge, identifying gaps in research, and formulating questions that will guide subsequent stages of the internship.

## **Stage 2: Coding and Visualization**
In this stage, interns apply coding skills to analyze biological data and create meaningful visualizations. Participants will work with programming languages such as Python or R, and learn to generate graphs, charts, and other visual aids that effectively communicate data-driven insights.

## **Stage 3: Pipeline Implementation for a basic problem set**
Participants will build and implement a bioinformatics pipeline to solve a predefined problem set. This stage introduces the practical aspects of workflow automation, data processing, and the integration of various bioinformatics tools to streamline the analysis of biological datasets.

## **Stage 4: Pipeline Implementation II: Reproducing a bioinformatics paper**
Interns will select a published bioinformatics paper and attempt to reproduce its results. This stage emphasizes critical thinking, technical accuracy, and the ability to follow complex methodologies. Reproducing a study reinforces your skill and confidence at scale, as well as the importance of reproducibility and validation in scientific research.

## **Stage 5-7: Final Project**
In the final stages of the internship, participants will undertake a comprehensive project that integrates the skills and knowledge acquired throughout the program. This project will involve identifying a research question, designing a bioinformatics approach, and presenting the findings. The final stages are designed to simulate a real-world research experience, preparing interns for professional roles in bioinformatics.
